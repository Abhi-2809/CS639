# CS639: Data Management for Data Science

This repository contains the implementation of various assignments completed as part of CS 639: Data Management for Data Science, taught by Professor Meenakshi Syamkumar at the University of Wisconsin-Madison during Spring 2025.

## Project Overview

- **Project 1: SQL Analysis of Chinook Music Store**
  - Comprehensive analysis of the Chinook Music Store database using MySQL, Docker, and Python (SQLAlchemy, Pandas) to perform data retrieval, complex joins, and advanced SQL operations including window functions and aggregations.

- **Project 2: MongoDB Analysis of Movie Database**
  - Advanced analysis of the sample_mflix database using MongoDB, Docker, and Python (PyMongo, GeoPandas) to perform complex queries, aggregations, and geospatial analysis of movie theaters and user comments.

- **Project 3: Elasticsearch and Interactive Kibana Maps**
  - Implementation of a Madison city data analysis system using Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Python to perform complex text searches, aggregations, and create interactive geospatial visualizations of local businesses and events.

- **Project 4: ELT Data Pipeline with Airbyte, Snowflake, and DBT**
  - Development of a modern data pipeline using Airbyte for data extraction and loading, Snowflake for data warehousing, and DBT for data transformation, including analysis of stock trading data and custom student survey datasets.

- **Project 5: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**
  - Implementation of various time series forecasting models including EMA, ARIMA, and gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) for sales prediction, with feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.

- **Project 6: LLM Fine-tuning and RAG Pipeline**
  - Development of an exam preparation chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs), including 4-bit quantization, LoRA fine-tuning on course transcripts, and implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Elasticsearch and Haystack.
